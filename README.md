# rblx-hologrounds
Meet hologrounds! An old lua roblox project I worked on. Its here for when I need my bi-yearly nostalgia trip for bad code that I wrote earlier in my life.
Every few years I also check up on it to make sure it still runs as roblox is a changing platform that sometimes deprecates things. At best I manage to patch it, at worst I call the new broken thing a feature.
